PLease note that the game does not run in browser, only in GitHub.

This is a port for GitHub, in case you dont use Scratch.
Please note that updates might take a bit to update in this port.

Controls:
Move mouse to move character.
Press Play to start.
Press F to change costumes.

Note: 
THIS GAME IS REALLY HARD! I encourage you to try your best. This game is short, but sweet.
In a future update, which may be the last, I'll make this game longer.
Currently due to school, it might have to be on a weekend, if I have homework.
